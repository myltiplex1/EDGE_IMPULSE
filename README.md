# EDGE_IMPULSE Projects
## Anime Character Classification - 
This project is a Raspberry Pi-powered machine learning model designed to classify and identify 9 specific anime characters: Alpha, Gojo, Hisoka, Ichigo, Kirito, Koro Sensei, Mikasa, Naruto and Zoro. Using the power of machine learning, this model efficiently recognizes these anime characters with precision, running seamlessly on a Raspberry Pi.

## Keyword Spotting-
The project uses machine learning to identify and differentiate between the specified keywords ("hello" and "stop") when spoken, while also distinguishing background noise and other irrelevant inputs as "unknown."

## Sound Spotting -
This project is designed to accurately detect two specific sounds—"fan" and "faucet"—while distinguishing other sounds as general background noise.

## Object Position Detection-
This project determines the position of an object using accelerometer data collected from a smartphone. It tracks and classifies various motion types such as circular motion, left-right movement, and up-down movement, as well as when the object is idle.
