# EDGE_IMPULSE Projects
## Anime Character Classification - 
This project is a Raspberry Pi-powered machine learning model designed to classify and identify 9 specific anime characters: Alpha, Gojo, Hisoka, Ichigo, Kirito, Koro Sensei, Mikasa, Naruto and Zoro. Using the power of machine learning, this model efficiently recognizes these anime characters with precision, running seamlessly on a Raspberry Pi.

## Keyword Spotting-
The project uses machine learning to identify and differentiate between the specified keywords ("hello" and "stop") when spoken, while also distinguishing background noise and other irrelevant inputs as "unknown."
